Reset spyder settings (plotting in automatic)

File and Variable explorer are useful!

We can actually run things in the bottom right just via the console (a bit like jupyter!)

#this part of the code is text

#print hello world

#print names and ages with format and without

#take the sum of the two ages, careful with input

#What are some game characters?

#make a for loop and output the first letter of each name of character

#import numpy, using nothing, as and from. floor and ceiling are two good examples

#numpy array is NOT like a list!

#try using random

#print random integer between limits 1,3

#%% import os

#show how to list the files, get the root of the files, make a new folder 

#save the base directory and go forward one, then go back one.

#go to a random directory using a raw string


#%% import PIL

#list the direcctory in the console and then change to the pictures file in your computer.

#save this directory as the pics_dir

#open image with PIL saved to an object and have a look in explorer window

#show it. then play with resize and crop

#save the dimensions using size()

#flappy bird doesn;t need a tall picture but we want a long one in x

#play around with using crop until we are happy with a 500 tall picture with x staying the same

#then make a new directory in the console called 'FB_pictures' - check in correct directory

#save the pictures in a list and open them in turn using a for loop!

#now lets try opening the python image - PNG!

#check the image mode in the console. A allows a transparent layer.

#make it greyscale using 'LA'

# r,g,b,a split()

# merge PIL.Image.merge('RGBA',)

#if we have time we can actually mirror it using the ImageOps which have to be imported in separately

#resize and 64,64
